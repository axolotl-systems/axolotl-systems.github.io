          <strong>I've managed teams that deployed ML models multiple times a day at Spotify and DPG Media.</strong> 
          Now I help other companies build the same capabilities so they can constantly optimize the metrics that actually matter.

          PhD in Search, previously Engineering Manager at Spotify where my teams deployed 50+ recommendation model updates per month to 400M+ users. 
          At DPG Media, I built the infrastructure that let data scientists deploy models in minutes instead of weeks.

        <h3>Where these opinions come from</h3>
        <p>
          At Spotify, I managed teams that deployed to millions of users daily. 
          The platform made everything self-service—getting a new cluster, scaling up, or running A/B tests 
          took minutes, not weeks. Speed was the default, not the exception.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Before that, at Google, DPG Media, and Blendle, I saw how different approaches to engineering scale. 
          Some companies move fast because they invest in the right infrastructure. 
          Others get stuck because they treat every deployment like a research project.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          My PhD taught me that search algorithms are fundamentally about user behavior and business metrics—not just relevance scores. 
          The same applies to ML: if you can't deploy and measure quickly, your sophisticated models don't matter.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>I'm opinionated because I've seen what works at scale.</strong> 
          Platform teams, golden paths, and self-service infrastructure aren't nice-to-haves—they're competitive advantages.
