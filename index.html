    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>I solve complex technical problems through building, evaluating, and consulting. My hands-on approach comes from shipping products at scale and staying current with real development work. I specialize in AI/ML systems but work with any software that needs to scale.</p>

    <p>Currently developing peerpressure—a collaborative focus app fighting phone addiction—and evaluating ML systems at Ditto.</p>
    
    <h2>Current Projects</h2>
    <p>Currently working on:</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://peerpressure.social/">peerpressure</a></strong> - Break phone addiction together. A collaborative focus app that uses social accountability to help users stay off distracting apps. Join shared focus sessions where peers keep each other on track - because willpower alone isn't enough.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://ditto.care">Ditto</a></strong> - Working on evaluation of ML components for this healthcare platform, applying my expertise in algorithmic assessment and performance analysis.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>PhD in Search Algorithms. Previously Engineering Manager at Spotify (500M+ users), Research Scientist at Google, Head of News Personalisation at DPG Media, and ML Engineer at Blendle. I've built and scaled recommendation systems, search algorithms, and ML platforms from prototype to production.</p>

    <h3>Product Development & ML Evaluation</h3>
    <p>I solve technical problems through hands-on building and rigorous evaluation. Currently shipping peerpressure, a social accountability app, while also working on ML component evaluation at Ditto. This active development work keeps me sharp on modern practices and real-world system challenges.</p>

    <h2>What's with the axolotl?</h2>
    <p>They're masters of regeneration—when something breaks, they rebuild it better. Just like good engineering teams. Plus, I wanted a company name that matched my initials (A.S.), and my eldest daughter's favorite animal made the perfect fit.</p>
