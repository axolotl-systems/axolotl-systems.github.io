    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>I build and deploy software systems to production. Whether you need rapid prototyping, production-scale infrastructure, or technical leadership, I bridge the gap between ideas and systems that serve real users. I specialize in AI/ML systems but work with any software that needs to scale.</p>
    
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>PhD in Search Algorithms. Previously Engineering Manager at Spotify (500M+ users), Research Scientist at Google, Head of News Personalisation at DPG Media, and ML Engineer at Blendle. I've built and scaled recommendation systems, search algorithms, and ML platforms from prototype to production.</p>
